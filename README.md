The Project consists of a Working Interface for the Problem Statement Received During the TechNova Hackathon.

Problem Statement: Patients Often Struggle To Understand And Act Upon The Results Of Their Medical Reports Due To Complex Medical Terminology And Lack Of Clear Guidance. Simultaneously, Doctors Face Challenges Managing And Reviewing Large Volumes Of Patient Reports Amidst Their Busy Schedules

Frontend:- Login Page, Patient page, Doctor Page (Reactjs, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
Backend:- MySql, Node.js
AI:- LangChain, LangGraph, EasyOcr, GeminiApi

The patient can submit a medical prescription/report  which will be summarized by the AI and will also highlight abnormalities and display root issues the same data will be shown to the patient and doctor and then the doctor can prescribe his actions which will be displayed with the note that it is advisable to follow doctor's prescription. There is also a choice for the patient to choose a specific doctor to whom he/she wants to access the prescription since people usually are much more preferential towards specific doctors for treatment.
